the openai [universe](https://github.com/openai/universe) is using VNC, almost doing the same thing.

you can find some demo models from [there](https://github.com/openai/universe-starter-agent).

check out [SerpentAI](https://github.com/SerpentAI/SerpentAI)

but why bother? we can build these things in the same way.

human demonstrations are limited, but random keystrokes are infinite.

try to obtain infinite data as pretrained data, then fine-tune on human demonstrations.
