# The Frozen Forest

A dataset of time-aligned keystrokes, mouse and screen recordings.

## Roadmap

Currently I only record these contents by running autostart scripts within our tiny little virtual machine, copy and rinse it before feeding into our model.

To train our mighty multimodal `cybergod`, I plan to add more modalities into this dataset, namely text, audio and more.
