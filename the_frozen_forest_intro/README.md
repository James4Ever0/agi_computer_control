# The Frozen Forest

A dataset of time-aligned keystrokes, mouse and screen recordings.


## Roadmap

Currently I only record these contents by running autostart scripts within our tiny little virtual machine, copy and rinse it before feeding into our model.

To train our mighty multimodal `cybergod`, I plan to add more modalities into this dataset, namely text, audio and more.

There are two type of computer agent datasets, one for Terminal datasets, and the other are GUI datasets.

Terminal (usually one-liner, not comparable to GUI datasets)

```

```

GUI datasets are way more than terminal ones.
