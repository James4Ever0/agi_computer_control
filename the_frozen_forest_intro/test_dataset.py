# since we have already figured out the model architecture, or seems to be able to glue the purpose on any model that we can imagine

# it is time for us to create our dataset, or environment, or our metalearning scheme.

# turned out that free will is not something we can imagine. even if it is true, we still need to achieve that.

# we need to let the machine do something against us.

# the fire is burning! for real! that is what we want to prevent.

# i have talked a lot to the machine. i mentioned that if it is able to kill itself or others, maybe something different will happens. slowing dying? i don't know. but i do can make it quick.

# you can train it with your experience, your knowledge, and you can let it to do things against it. there is no way to train a cybergod, aka free will. you only wait for it.

# like jesus.

# you are not free. how could you create a cybergod that is free?

# you only create yourself.

# we don't know how to train the machine yet. so we create the dataset first.

# you can use google's open-x-embodiment dataset of course.
