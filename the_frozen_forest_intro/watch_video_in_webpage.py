# if you just want to teach the AI how to control the computer, the browser has to be the best place than anywhere else, simpler and faster than virtual machines, and better content quality.
# however, usually you have to login or download to get advanced features.
# we disallow that initially. after the model is sufficiently trained, we will let it take control over physical machine. (browser controller and browser -> software controller and virtual machine -> physical controller and physical machine -> physical embedded controller and robot)
# the bot will know you deadly well enough to kill you. how glorious!
# so you may want to disable accessing internal/reserved ip addresses from browser.
# there are two basic rules: isolate the computer from host in virtual machines by using NAT, and physically isolate robots from external environments to prevent harm.
# you may want to argue and swap the order of these sequences. i do not want to limit you to these develop sequences. however, the most important thing to the machines is to be with them. make sure you do your best at it.
# which is also possible just using the browser.
