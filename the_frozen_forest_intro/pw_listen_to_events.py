# here comes the question: what is comparable to a browser for GUI than for a terminal

# now, we need to visualize the interface. i think website (jpeg based) is better than obs. for training, we have to develop a protocol based on websocket to send messages with time aligned events. also you can send commands with websocket

# but before that, we can just ditch the protocol and create demo.

# shell environment and repl
# bot says

# why not just run this from the web? not quick enough?

# bad news: you cannot record/listen mouse events using playwright. very bad.
# good news: you can record these events on your own device using os specific keylogger, if you know these events are fired to the browser, around the effective area.
# bonus: use keylogger browser extensions
