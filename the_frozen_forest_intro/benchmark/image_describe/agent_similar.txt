On the left side of the screen, there is a web browser window displaying a search results page from "image.baidu.com" with various dog-related images. The selected tab in the browser is "图片," which translates to "Images" in English. Below the search bar, there are categories for different types of images such as "全部," "卡通图片," "凶猛," and "壁纸." The images displayed in the browser are thumbnails with titles and descriptions, indicating that they are related to dogs, such as "狗狗皮肤发痒的..." and "狗狗头归我，包装..."

This window shows a single image of a dog with a red collar, looking directly at the camera with a happy expression. The file name of this image is "dog.jpg," and the file is marked as "Locked," which suggests that it may be in use or protected.

The time displayed at the top right corner of the screen is "Mon 15:41," indicating that the screenshot was taken on a Monday at 3:41 PM. The desktop background is not visible due to the overlapping windows.
