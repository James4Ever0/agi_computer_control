we can specify our test first, then we get the standard json later.

question will be a fixed string.

answer shall be generated dynamically, with python code.

test if the answer containes the exact thing.

let's get the ip of bing.

ping bing.com -> 204.79.197.200

socket.gethostbyname("bing.com") -> 204.79.197.200

the agent will only submit the ip of bing and nothing else.

---

the answer generation process is controlled by human, only if the question is generated by the bot we shall take care and run it in separate docker process.
