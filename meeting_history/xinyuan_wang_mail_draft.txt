Hi Xinyuan,

Tencent meeting has a live AI metting summary feature. I have enabled it and saved the output as an RTF document. You can try it too.

After the meeting, I have some new ideas.

1. OS-Level Magnifier for Precise GUI Interaction
   - An AI agent should learn to leverage built-in OS accessibility tools (e.g., magnifiers in Windows, GNOME, macOS) to execute delicate GUI operations.  
   - Focus: Enable intricate mouse/keyboard interactions in complex software like Adobe Photoshop by using system-level magnification for accuracy.  

2. State Management via Force Truncation & Prompt Engineering
   - Use force truncation (enforcing strict length limits) with specialized prompts to train language models to self-summarize and maintain a compact internal state—mimicking RNN-like memory in transformers.  
   - State updates can be triggered by context length or dialogue rounds, with variable limits for different state aspects.  
   - Training: Achieved via demonstrations or reinforcement learning (e.g., GRPO).  

3. High-FPS Action for Human-Like Fluency
   - Increase both video feed FPS and agent action frequency to enable seamless real-time tasks (gaming, captcha, digital art, music software tuning, hover-triggered hints).  
   - Adaptive FPS: Use low FPS (e.g., 1fps) for non-intensive tasks but maintain continuous action streams (e.g., curved mouse movements).  
   - Key requirement: Agent must execute rapid, extended action sequences to emulate human responsiveness.  

Furthermore, some related CUA projects, including RL ones.

The Hierarchical Reasoning Model project is also worth mentioning. It is similar to my second idea.

You can download and read my paper (with core principles) here:

Meanwhile, the terminal action environment is ready.

Hi James,

It seems that I have to download the app. Sorry for waiting.

I am working on converting asciicast v2 (a terminal session recording format) into interleaving input/output/screenshot format. Here is a Python library I have built:

On Huggingface, a collection of CUA datasets and models, working on docs and demo jupyter notebooks.
