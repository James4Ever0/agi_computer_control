ProcessEvent

tmux_trials/lib.py has event emitters

lib.py does not connect event stats to watcher panes

tmux_trials/test_lib.py failed to start within cybergod env, python3 test_lib.py

start_daemon_threads(test_keys, env) has been commented out

server reset in watcher init. need to stop reset

[+] Tmux session 'test_session' created                            
[*] Calculated idle threshold: 5 sec(s)                            
[+] Tmux env created             
[*] Requesting cursor coordinates           
can't find session: test_session_viewer      
[Loading] /tmp/tmpcil0n90k.json        
[*] Executing command: tmux -L test_server kill-server   
[+] Server 'test_server' reset complete

potential cause: loading from nested tmux session, tmuxp loader does not set TMUX environment to empty string
potential fix: attach 'env TMUX= ' prefix to cmd in method tmuxp_load_from_filepath

fix: first load tmuxp manifest without attaching to it, then attach manually with 'env TMUX= ' prefix using method 'tmux_prepare_attach_command'

fix has been implemented
