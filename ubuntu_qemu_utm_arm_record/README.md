you need to make all scripts under this folder read-only.

mount folder related to recordings separately.

so you need to mount two webdav folders, one is read-only, one is writable.

name your dataset as "the frozen forest". name this model as "cybergod".

design logo for both of them.

where is the damn mouse cursor? shall we use obs instead of mss?

create exception hooks for all recorders. if any exception is thrown just set redis flag to disable/false/off.

on ubuntu 16.04 we only have python3.5, however we can install up-to-date python via snap. will it work? (nope. network sucks.)

you can also consider conda?

sudo snap install core snapd

sudo apt install snapd ubuntu-core-snapd-units

xrandr --output Virtual1 --mode 1280x800

pip3 install pip==18.0

pip3 install --user -r requirements.txt

sudo apt install python3-tk python3-dev

sudo apt install ffmpeg

sudo python3 main_recorder.py

the wallpaper can change. better execute some command to check if screen is locked.
