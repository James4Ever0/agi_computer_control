# Public GUI and Terminal CUA datasets

A collection of public computer using datasets for training and testing agent-based models

## Objectives

Discover, rearrange and document public datasets, models and code about Cybergod

We create collections on Huggingface, and lists on Github.

We put document as notes in collections/lists per discovery.

## Folder structure

```
./github_third_party_documentation // docs for third party github projects, referenced in github lists
./huggingface_third_party_documentation // docs for third party huggingface projects, referenced in huggingface collections
```

## How to find more computer using agent datasets?

For computer/terminal human usage demo video, visit popular video sites like YouTube, Bilibili, etc. (Such video source will be referenced as URL, with data download and curation method provided)

Search in Bing, ask AI with these queries:

Optionally, replace "dataset" with "collection"
