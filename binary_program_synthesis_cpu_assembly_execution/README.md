I had an idea that programs shall ingest programs and learn to evolve in a evolutionary manner.

The program shall directly execute assembly code. So obviously, no human interface is needed.

You may ask how do we interact with such program? Consider computer virus. We first run it in isolated environments, then we interact.

you may make hierarchical tokenizer or hierarchical embedding to reduce memory consumption
