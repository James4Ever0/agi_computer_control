my ideas are not new. my ideas are similar to others. however, it is not easy to directly get those external ideas in (find their code implementation), or get my internal ideas out (implement as code).

so for all kinds of ideas, i would like to use ai to do these two type of heavy liftings. both are indexed by vector database, search engines or recommendation systems, backed by RAG

for my ideas, use ai to explain, tag and write code examples. explain my code and connect to some ideas/questions.

for other ideas, collect from some specialized sources, find code implementation & model weights when possible, write demo code on how to use them, treat these external ideas just like mine.

it is however important to admit some uniqueness in human beings, and be proud of that. only in this way we can get the full potential out of machines, instead of delusionally rebuilding a new body of our own.
