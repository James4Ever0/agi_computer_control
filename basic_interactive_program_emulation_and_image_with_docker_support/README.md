as long as you know how to train the bot, you are fine.

first, the coordination training. you may want thee bot to track and click specific location. 

next, the typing training. you create a dataset of typing against your random typing program.

you may also illustrate the action of browsing website, downloading software, playing games, coding and more.

nevermind. performing actions is critical to the bot, since that is the only way to resolve repetition, do reproduction and become autonomous.

you can always let the bot to do (relatively) meaningless things like random clicking. and it always works. meaning will arise from groups and communications.

let the bot to explore and learn.
