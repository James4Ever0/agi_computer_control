instead of extacting every frame created by agg, we are going to use the classic 1 FPS sampling frequency.

we can configure the fps directly at agg.

the time alignment with original .cast file requires further investigation.

if time alignment is a problem, simply investigate the agg rust codebase and pick up the rendering part only.

also, test if agg can render utf-8 outputs (inclusing cjk characters)
